# MallPlot

Mallplot creates ERC721 tokens for trading virtual reality property in a virtual reality mall. 
Each shop is owned and checked ownership through by verifying an address owns a certain MallPlot token before allowing to edit the VR space.

The long term goal for this project is to have a large decentralized VR space where participants can own and edit their shops through these tokens.

This project so far has a demo of the contracts, as well as an interface in react that demonstrates how users would be able to buy sell and trade these tokens.
