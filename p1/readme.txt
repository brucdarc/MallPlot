I didn't run into many problems implementing this project and using the technologies, most of it was pretty straight forward.

There were some things that I tried to do that the compiler would yell at me for them being depreciated.
I fixed one of them, but ignored most and everything worked fine. For example address(this).balance was one of the fixes.

I deployed to the rinkeby test network, and was able to successfully run the auction, transfer the money from
the highest bidder to the owner, and get the money out for all other participants. I also tested and
made sure that the winner couldn't take money out after he paid for the item on the Javascript VM, and I 
am correctly setting his bid to 0 so he cannot remove money.

There are 6 screenshots with this.

The balances of all 3 accounts at auction start and end.

The transactions to and from the contract from https://rinkeby.etherscan.io 

The two pages of user interfaces generated by 1 click dapp.

The source code of the contract is also here.
